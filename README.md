# Hi, I'm Luke and I like programming and activism

## Languages
- Rust
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML and CSS
- C
- C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python

## Tools
- I'm comfortable with JS frameworks like ReactJS, Vue, and Svelte, and my preferred meta-frameworks are Next.js and SvelteKit
- I also like more low level programming with languages like Rust, C, and C++
- I'm trying to build cross-platform apps with Flutter and Dart, because of it's ability to compile to so many targets like machine code or JS. Also, flutter_rust_bridge sounds exciting
