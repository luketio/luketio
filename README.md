# Hi, I'm Luke and I like programming and activism

## Languages
- Rust
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML
- C
- C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python
- SCSS(idk how to use vanilla CSS)

## Tools
- I'm comfortable with most JS frameworks including Angular, ReactJS, Vue, but my preferred frameworks are Next.js and Svelte
- I also like more low level programming with languages like Rust, C, and C++
- I'm trying my hand in GUI Desktop apps in JVM languages besides Java(like Kotlin) bc I don't enjoy `public static void main(String[] args)` but I still like how portable cross-platform JVM libraries are
