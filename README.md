# Hi, I'm Luke and I like programming and activism

## Languages
- Rust
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- HTML and CSS
- C
- C++
- Java
- Kotlin
- Python

## Tools
- I'm comfortable with most JS frameworks including Angular, ReactJS, Vue, but my preferred frameworks are Next.js and Svelte
- I also like more low level programming with languages like Rust, C, and C++
- I'm trying to build more cross-platform apps with Flutter and Dart, because of it's ability to compile to so many targets like machine code or JS. Also, flutter_rust_bridge sounds exciting
